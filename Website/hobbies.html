        <h2>Gymnastics Coach / Supervisor / Party Coordinator</h2>
        <p>I work at Tricks Gymnastics where my responsibilities include teaching gymnastics, supervising classes, and coordinating birthday parties. I teach gymnastics skills of varying difficulty to kids ranging from age 5 to 13. When I am on the clock as a supervisor, or as we call it at Tricks, "Senior Coach," I am responsible for all classes going on in the gym, which can be upwards of ten classes at one time. I deal with any problems that arise pertaining to parents, students, coaches, or schedules. In addition, I also coordinate birthday parties that happen at Tricks on some Saturdays. This includes communicating with parents about their expectations for the party, setting up the party room, and making sure the coach that is providing entertainment stays on schedule.</p>

        <h2>Traveling</h2>
        <p>I love traveling because I am the type of person that likes to branch out and try new things. I find it extremely exciting to be immersed in a culture that is different from mine. My two international experiences have been mission trips with my church. I enjoy going on these types of trips because not only do I get to serve others, but I also get to be immersed in the other culture from day one. This past summer, I went to Malawi, Africa where I helped teach children and performed work projects in the local villages. As an extrovert, I love meeting new people, and on that trip, I built great connections with people that live halfway across the world from me.</p>

        <h2>Personal Projects</h2>
        <p>I enjoy learning learning computer languages and applying what I've learned to personal projects. I taught myself Java and created a program which can be found under the "Code Samples" section of this website. In addition, I relearned HTML and CSS and built this website from scratch. I love being able to showcase my creativity through technology.</p>

        <h2>Sports</h2>
        <p>Sports have always been a large part of my life. Athletics are a good outlet for me to clear my mind for a couple of hours, as well as unleash my competitive nature.</p>
        <p>I joined the cross country and track and field teams in high school, and I've been running ever since. I am a two-time marathoner, and have hopes to qualify for the Boston Marathon next year. In addition, I would consider myself an avid skier and hiker. I find sports to be a great way to socialize with people, and do something good for your body.</p>
